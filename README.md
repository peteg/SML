Assorted Standard ML
--------------------

Extracted from various places.

Lightly tested on Poly/ML and mlton.

See `Makefile` for entry points.

TODO
~~~~

* put Poly/ML multithreading back on its feet
* smlnj-lib/Util/scan.sml conflicts with basis/scan.ML
* get `http_server` to attach the right MIME type by default
* check `cleanup` in `http_server`: mlton objects to closing those streams
